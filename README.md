1. Project Name and Tag Line
Project Name: XGRAD
Tag Line: “Empowering ALX Graduates with Freelance Opportunities”
2. Team Members
Name: MKADMI NABIL
Role: Full Stack Developer — Handling all aspects of development, from front-end to back-end, including QA and testing.
Role Decision Rationale: Opting for a solo project to challenge myself across the full stack of development technologies and manage the project end-to-end.
3. Technologies
Technologies List:
Front-End: React.js for the UI, TailwindCSS for styling.
Back-End: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, MongoDB for the database.
Deployment & Version Control: Docker for containerization, AWS for hosting, and GitHub for source control.
Technology Choices Explained:
React.js: Selected for its modular architecture, making it manageable for a solo developer to build and maintain the UI.
MongoDB: Chosen for its flexibility with data schemas, which suits the evolving needs of a project being developed by a single person.
4. Challenge Statement
Problem to Solve: Creating a platform that connects ALX graduates to freelance opportunities, facilitating their transition into the tech industry.
What It Won’t Solve: It’s not a replacement for comprehensive job search platforms but focuses on freelance gigs for ALX grads.
Target Users: Specifically ALX graduates looking for freelance projects and clients needing skilled, vetted freelancers.
Locale Relevance: Designed to be globally accessible, catering to the worldwide ALX community.
5. Risks
Technical Risks: As a solo developer, the primary risk is managing the workload and ensuring all aspects of the platform are well-developed. Time management and prioritization will be key.
Non-Technical Risks: Building a user base. Strategies include leveraging the ALX community for initial users and marketing the platform on social media and through ALX channels.
6. Infrastructure
Branching/Merging: Will use a simplified GitHub flow, with separate branches for new features and a main branch for production releases.
Deployment Strategy: Automated deployments through GitHub Actions to AWS, ensuring quick updates and fixes.
Data Population: Plan to manually seed the database with initial data, moving towards user-generated content as the platform grows.
Testing: Emphasis on manual testing initially, with plans to incorporate automated tests using tools like Jest for backend and Cypress for frontend as the project develops.
7. Existing Solutions
Comparison: While platforms like Upwork and Freelancer are broad in scope, XGRAD will specifically serve ALX graduates, providing a niche marketplace that understands their skills and potential.
Rationale: The focus on ALX graduates is to ensure a high-quality pool of freelancers and projects tailored to the strengths of the ALX curriculum, filling a gap in the existing freelance marketplace landscape.
